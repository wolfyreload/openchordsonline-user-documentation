It allows one to easily present songs with chords on a computer screen as well as transpose song key on the fly. Its easy to use, and has a clutter-free interface. Background \u00b6 OpenChords Online was built to solve three primary needs: Easily transpose the key of a song I wanted a fully paperless system because filing music is tedious I wanted to use the app on multiple devices and all the songs need to be accessible and in sync for every device. The closest application I could find is the fantastic presentation software by the name of OpenSong. OpenSong allowed me to easily transpose and make printed sheets of songs. However, this didn't solve my filing issue. I was then inspired to make a paperless song system for musicians. Hence, OpenChords was born. Later I learned how to use Angular and create web user interfaces then OpenChords Online was born as the successor to OpenChords. Recently, I've found that most lyrics church projection software doesn't work very well between multiple users. So I've added basic lyric projection functionality to OpenChords Online. If you wish to contact me for suggestions or to report bugs, you can email me at openchords.app@gmail.com Logging in \u00b6 I'm going to assume that the application is running in an WebService in Azure. E.g. https://cloud-openchordsonline.azurewebsites.net","title":"Welcome"},{"location":"#overview","text":"OpenChords Online is a digital songbook for musicians.
